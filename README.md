# AirBnB Clone Project

## Description of the project

The AirBnB Clone Project is a Python-based web application that emulates the functionality of the popular online hospitality platform, Airbnb. The project aims to create a simplified version of Airbnb where users can manage various objects (e.g., users, states, cities, places) using a command-line interface (CLI).

## Command Interpreter

The project includes a command interpreter that allows users to interact with the system. The command interpreter provides a set of commands for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting objects, as well as performing operations on these objects. It also handles serialization and deserialization of these objects.

## How to Start

To start the AirBnB command interpreter, you need to clone the project's GitHub repository and execute the `console.py` script.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/AirBnB_clone.git
   cd AirBnB_clone
